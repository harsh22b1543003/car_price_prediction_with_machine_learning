## ðŸš€ Brief Idea
The goal of a car price prediction project is to use machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data on car prices and make predictions about future prices. This involves collecting large amounts of data on different car models, their features, and their prices over time.

Once the data has been collected and organized, the next step is to choose an appropriate machine learning model and train it on the data. This involves feeding the model the historical data on car prices, allowing it to learn the patterns and relationships between the different features and their impact on the price.

After the model has been trained, it can then be used to predict future car prices based on new data inputs. For example, if a new car model is released, the model can analyze its features and predict its price based on the historical data.

Overall, a car price prediction project can be a valuable tool for consumers, car dealerships, and manufacturers to better understand and anticipate changes in the automotive market.
